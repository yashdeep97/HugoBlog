The results are out and I have been selected for GSoC 2018!
I couldn't be more thrilled as I take my first step into the Open Source World.

### The Journey so far...
I have been able to learn a lot of new things during the GSoC application period, from the initial confusion of choosing the right project and organisation to submitting a proposal.
After going through a lot of different projects of various organisations, I decided the Page Forms project by Wikimedia Foundation was the right project for me. Then I started contributing to it and understanding the various features to be implemented as part of the project.

Although the journey was a bit overwhelming and difficult at first, I received a lot of guidance from Yaron along the way as I tried my hand at couple of microtasks and fixing a few bugs.
Bala and Nischay encouraged me and helped me refine my proposal and take it to completion.
The couple of weeks before the application deadline were a bit stressfull with the pressure to write a good proposal and making more contributions, along with balancing my academic requirements. I also received help from my batchmates (particularly, Rohitt and Arnav), who encouraged me throughout the process.
Finally, I submitted my proposal and the wait for the results began. I was anxious about the results, but when they came out, I was feeling on top of the world!

The entire journey has instilled a lot of confidance in me and has given me a sense of achievement. :)

### My project: Add a Spreadheet Interface to the Page Forms Extension
**Introduction:** The Page Forms extension for MediaWiki is currently used to create and edit pages using an interface made up of forms that simplify the process. The Forms can be used to add and edit template calls in the pages. This project aims to add a special page that provides a spreadsheet-like interface ( rendered using jsGrid ) that will allow administrators of a wiki to edit multiple pages at once.

I made some **mockups** for it:
